# CodSoft-Java-Development-Internship
I have completed tasks given for my internship as a Java Programmer in CodSoft.

Task 1:- Number Game

Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number. You can incorporate additional details as follows:
Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
Task 2:- Word Counter

Prompt the user to enter a text or provide a file to count the words.
Read the input text or file and store it in a string.
Split the string into an array of words using space or punctuation as delimiters.
Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of words.
Iterate through the array of words and increment the counter for each word encountered.
Display the total count of words to the user. You can further enhance the project by adding features such as:
Ignoring common words or stop words.
Providing statistics like the number of unique words or the frequency of each word.
Implementing input validation to handle empty inputs or file errors.
Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Task 3:- ATM Interface 1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine. 2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. 3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance(). 4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance. 5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance. 6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals) 7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
